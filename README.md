Mannaging permissions as a Help Desk Admin allows me to create folders or programs that are either visible to a public network or private network using a program called Active Directory (AD). AD is a program used to systematicallyy manage thousands of groups from one computer source. As an admin, I can use the properties tab in every user's folder I employ or manage to read/write files, view only, or make files exclusively visible to specific users. This option provides security and convenience to manange a company of multiple departments regarding networking access. To use AD properly, I need to create another VM on Azure as a Windows Server in order to access Server Manager on Windows virtually. This will allow me access to install Active Directory and manage files and storages as an admin to control from one to thousands of users.
